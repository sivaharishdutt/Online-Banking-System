1. run server.c file first

admin username: admin
admin password: password

if there is any binding error delete the a.out file and run it again

I used dat extension file for saving data (for data protection).


Used socket programming â€“ Server maintains the data base and service multiple clients
concurrently. Client program can connect to the server and access their specific account
details.

Used system calls instead of Library functions wherever it is possible in the project:
Process Management, File Management, File Locking, Multithreading and Inter Process
Communications.
